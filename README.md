# azure-via-vpn
Powershell script that downloads json with all Azure services and regions and allows you to reroute traffic to specific ones over a VPN connection. Very useful once you are forced to access your corporate subscriptions from behind a VPN but you do not want to reroute all traffic to Internet via corporate VPN.
